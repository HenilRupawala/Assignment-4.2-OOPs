    "To achieve data abstraction, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a Class: \n",
    "Create a class that represents the abstract concept or entity you want to work with. Determine the essential attributes and behaviors of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulate Data:\n",
    "Encapsulate the data related to the class by defining instance variables (attributes) within the class. Make these variables private by prefixing them with double underscores (__). Encapsulation ensures that the internal representation of the class is hidden and can only be accessed through defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Define Methods:\n",
    "Define methods (member functions) within the class that provide the necessary functionality and behavior. These methods should interact with the encapsulated data and perform the desired operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Provide a Public Interface:\n",
    "Decide which methods should be accessible to the users of your class (public interface). Mark these methods as public by not using the double underscore prefix. The public interface provides a simplified and well-defined way to interact with the objects of your class."
